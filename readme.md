# Readme
Welcome to the CrystalsCollector Game! This game is a variant of the classic hangman game, where instead of
guessing letters, the goal is to guess random numbers associated with a given gemstone. Game rules are explained 
in more detail on the page itself.

Feel free to fork the project submit any suggested changes by way of a pull request!
